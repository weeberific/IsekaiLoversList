This is a list of 110 dubbed anime for Isekai lovers. To be clear, not every show on here is technically an Isekai (literally meaning "another world"), I'm aiming for the modern style of show that most people think of when they think of "Isekai", that means shows on this list will typically have at least a couple of several attributes:

* Another World - Literally an Isekai, however, there are shows that feature other worlds that I don't personally consider "Isekai" in the colloquial sense
* RPG Fantasy Features - Fantasy setting that has many of the features of either tabletop RPGs (D&D), or JRPGs. This means rankings, levels, guilds, classes, enemies dropping loot, etc.
* Video Game Worlds - Since I consider Sword Art Online sort of the father of the modern Isekai movement, at least in anime form, I'd be remiss to not count anime that takes place inside a video game in this list.
* Reincarnation or Fresh Starts - A lot of Isekais are all about getting a fresh start in another world, but if they achieve the same thing via other means, I'll count it.

Because I see "Isekai" as a story mechanic, rather than a genre, my goal is to find shows that scratch that same itch, rather than seeking out shows that technically match the description of "another world". For this same reason, I'm leaving out almost all older shows (pre-2006) that are technically "Isekais," such as "Vision of Escaflowne", "Now and Then, Here and There", "Inuyasha", "Those Who Hunt Elves", ".hack/Sign", and similar shows.

Obviously my tiers and rankings are subjective, I'm not a huge Slice of Life fan, so you may find those shows tend to be ranked lower than you might think they deserve. I'm also perfectly happy with harem shows, so that also might mean you'll disagree with how I've ranked those. However, my previous attempts to use other metrics, such as MAL scores, have left me dissatisfied. So they'll remain in tiers I decide, sorted alphabetically within each tier. If you disagree, it's my list, and I'm a massive Isekai fan, so do you really expect me to have good taste?

*Categories:* Overpowered MC, Comedy, Fantasy, Action, Harem

*Description:* Separated from his classmates during summoning, MC discovers a fruit that makes him OP. He also starts building his harem, but not with human women

*Comments:* Primarily a comedy, the show has some hilarious bits, but feels quite aimless, the second season doesn't improve on this



[The Greatest Demon Lord Is Reborn as a Typical Nobody](https://myanimelist.net/anime/48415/Shijou_Saikyou_no_Daimaou_Murabito_A_ni_Tensei_suru)

*Categories:* Fantasy, Action, Battle School, Harem

*Description:* After becoming too powerful and renowned, MC decides to reincarnate for a chance at a normal life, unfortunately it's not that simple

*Comments:* Fairly generic harem builder, OP MC, fantasy show. Good if that's what you want, but nothing special



[The Legendary Hero is Dead!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/51706/Yuusha_ga_Shinda)

*Length:* 1 Season, 12 Episodes

*Categories:* Comedy, Ecchi, Fantasy, Action

*Description:* Thighs and stockings-obsessed MC accidentally kills the hero with a trap, so his soul is transferred into the hero's body to save the world

*Comments:* Lots of ecchi humor and silliness, mixed with some typical fantasy action, not a great show, but fun enough

*Categories:* Ecchi, Harem, Military, Technology Development, Civilization Building, Action

*Description:* Using his smartphone, MC utilizes more modern technology and strategy to expand his empire

*Comments:* Seriously squandered its potential, having a nation's leader have access to futuristic technology and strategies could've been so cool, but this show got stuck focusing on the harem and super powers aspects instead


### E Tier

*I struggle to recommend these, even if you like Isekai*


[I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40586/Slime_Taoshite_300-nen_Shiranai_Uchi_ni_Level_Max_ni_Nattemashita)

*Categories:* Comedy, Slice of Life, Fantasy

*Description:* Reincarnated with immortality, MC decides she will spend her next life as blissfully as possible, before she knows it 300 years have gone by

*Comments:* Fairly episodic show spending most of its time adding new cast members, it's cutesy and fun, but has no real stakes and nothing particularly interesting happens



[The Ambition of Oda Nobuna](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11933/Oda_Nobuna_no_Yabou)

*Length:* 1 Season, 12 Episodes

*Categories:* Military, Historical, Harem

*Description:* Stuck in a genderbent Japanese History, MC uses his knowledge of Japan's Sengoku war period to help recreate history

*Comments:* If you're into the Sengoku period you'll like this one, otherwise it's honestly not worth the watch, I kept thinking it'd get better and it never did



[The Silver Guardian](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32936/Gin_no_Guardian)

*Length:* 2 Seasons, 18 Episodes (First 12 are 10 minutes each)

*Categories:* Game, Fantasy, Action

*Description:* MC's favorite game is shutting down, only immediately after finding romance in it. Now he must save her in a new game where he's been given a leg up

*Comments:* Fairly odd show, first season is half episodes, and basically only gets through what I would consider the prologue, the story is at times a bit disorganized, and the 2nd season sort of turns into a generic RPG game show, but it's not bad


### F tier

*I honestly can't recommend watching these, they were painful slogs*


[Conception](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37823/Conception)

*Categories:* Ecchi, Harem, Comedy, Action, Fantasy

*Description:* MC has to gain the trust and have sexytimes with each member of an oversized harem in order to produce ""Star Children"" to help them defeat an enemy in order to return home

*Comments:* Bounces between comedy, seriousness, action, ecchi, harem, and honestly just does a poor job of all of them, really not worth the watch

*Length:* 1 Season, 12 Episodes

*Categories:* Fantasy, Technology Development

*Description:* Girl is reincarnated into generic medieval world without magic and given the OP ability to create potions of any kind magically

*Comments:* Generic story and an art style only a step above chibis, with an extremely unlikeable MC who fickly picks winners and swings between brash decisions and lame moralizing



[Isekai Cheat Magician](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37744/Isekai_Cheat_Magician)

*Length:* 1 Season, 12 Episodes

*Categories:* Overpowered MC, Action, Fantasy

*Description:* A pair is summoned into a fantasy world and both have powerful magic, they have to help protect their new world

*Comments:* Possibly the most bland Isekai I've seen, I could barely bring myself to finish it, it seems like it had some promise at the start, but just ends up being a boring power fantasy, with nothing special to set it apart

*Categories:* Overpowered MC, Fantasy, Slice of Life, Action, Harem

*Description:* Despite being unable to level up, reincarnated overworked MC has the ability to get amazing drops, the source of everything in this world

*Comments:* An interesting and unique power initially just quickly makes the MC OP, and the show really doesn't do much interesting with that, really gets pretty boring



[The Ones Within](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37926/Nakanohito_Genome_Jikkyouchuu)

*Length:* 1 Season, 12 Episodes

*Categories:* Game, Comedy, Psychological
