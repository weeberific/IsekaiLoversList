* Description: After getting stuck in an MMORPG, MC decides to use his overwhelming power to conquer the world

* Length: 1 Season, 13 Episodes
* Categories: Game, Action, Fantasy, Skill Acquisition

* Comments: Fairly odd show, first season is half episodes, and basically only gets through what I would consider the prologue, the story is at times a bit disorganized, and the 2nd season sort of turns into a generic RPG game show, but it's not bad


[I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40586/Slime_Taoshite_300-nen_Shiranai_Uchi_ni_Level_Max_ni_Nattemashita)
